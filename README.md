This is my 2nd project in C++ where using if-ladder statements, i need to compute for the income given the monthly sales.

Here are my formulas:

  1. 50,000 or greater = 575 + (monthlysales * 16%)
  2. 40,000 or greater = 550 + (monthlysales * 14%)
  3. 30,000 or greater = 525 + (monthlysales * 12%)
  4. 20,000 or greater = 500 + (monthlysales * 9%)
  5. 10,000 or greater = 450 + (monthlysales * 5%)
  6. Less than 10,000 = 400 + (monthlysales * 3%)
